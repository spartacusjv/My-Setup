                        FISH PATH SETUP
						
# I just instaLLed mycooLthing and need to add it to the path to use it. 
# It is at /opt/mycooLthing/bin/mycooLthing

# so Let's add the directory: /opt/mycooLthing/bin
	fish_add_path /opt/mycoolthing/bin

# I want my -/.LocaL/bin to be checked first,even if it was aLready added. 
	fish_add_path -m ~/.local/bin

# I prefer using a gLobaL fish_user_paths 
# This isn't saved automaticaLLy, I need to add this to config.fish if I want it to stay. 
	fish_add_path -g ~/.local/bin ~/.otherbin /usr/local/sbin
	
# I want to append to the entire $PATH because this directory contains faLLbacks 
# This needs --path/-P because otherwise it appends to $fish_user_paths,which is added to the front of $PATH.
	fish_add_path --append --path /opt/fallback/bin
 
# I want to add the bin/ directory of my current $PWD (say /home/nemo/)
# -v/--verbose shows what fish_ add path did. 
	fish_add_path -v bin/ 
	set fish user paths /home/nemo/bin /usr/bin /home/nemo/.LocaL/bin 
# I have instaLLed ruby via homebrew 
	fish_add_path /usr/local/opt/ruby/bin
	

# Restart Fish shell
exec fish

# Remove  from PATH
set -e fish_user_paths (echo $fish_user_paths | grep -v 'mnt/c')

#Pass command to fish without entering it
fish -c 'comands'
